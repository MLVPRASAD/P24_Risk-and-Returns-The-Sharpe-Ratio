Meet Professor William Sharpe\n<p>An investment may make sense if we expect it to return more money than it costs. But returns are only part of the story because they are risky - there may be a range of possible outcomes. How does one compare different investments that may deliver similar results on average, but exhibit different levels of risks?</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: left ; margin: 5px 20px 5px 1px;\" width=\"200\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_66/img/sharpe.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Enter William Sharpe. He introduced the <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/sr.htm\"><em>reward-to-variability ratio</em></a> in 1966 that soon came to be called the Sharpe Ratio. It compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. In particular, it looks at the difference in returns for two investments and compares the average difference to the standard deviation (as a measure of risk) of this difference. A higher Sharpe ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. It is common to compare a specific opportunity against a benchmark that represents an entire category of investments.</p>\n<p>The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance, not least because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</p>\n<p>Let's learn about the Sharpe ratio by calculating it for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. As a benchmark, we'll use the S&amp;P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US.</p>"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"dc":{"key":"3"}},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"source":"# Importing required modules\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Settings to produce nice plots in a Jupyter notebook\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Reading in the data\nstock_data = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/stock_data.csv\",parse_dates= True, index_col='Date').dropna()\nbenchmark_data = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/benchmark_data.csv\",parse_dates= True, index_col='Date').dropna()"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"11"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"editable":false,"deletable":false,"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Conclusion\n<p>Given the two Sharpe ratios, which investment should we go for? In 2016, Amazon had a Sharpe ratio twice as high as Facebook. This means that an investment in Amazon returned twice as much compared to the S&amp;P 500 for each unit of risk an investor would have assumed. In other words, in risk-adjusted terms, the investment in Amazon would have been more attractive.</p>\n<p>This difference was mostly driven by differences in return rather than risk between Amazon and Facebook. The risk of choosing Amazon over FB (as measured by the standard deviation) was only slightly higher so that the higher Sharpe ratio for Amazon ends up higher mainly due to the higher average daily returns for Amazon. </p>\n<p>When faced with investment alternatives that offer both different returns and risks, the Sharpe Ratio helps to make a decision by adjusting the returns by the differences in risk and allows an investor to compare investment opportunities on equal terms, that is, on an 'apples-to-apples' basis.</p>"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"dc":{"key":"74"}},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"source":"# Uncomment your choice.\nbuy_amazon = True\n# buy_facebook = True"}],"nbformat_minor":2}
